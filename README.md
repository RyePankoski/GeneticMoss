This is a simulation of some moss. Each moss can grow in one of the 4 cardinal directions. When a new moss is born, it inherets the rgb color of its parent, then it recieves a random mutation to its color values, with
a bias towards the genetic marker of its parents. If its genes drift enough, it gets a new genetic marker. To play with the sim, just make sure you have pygame and numpy installed. 

Live moss.

A pixmap of all the mosses history, so you can see the genetic history!
